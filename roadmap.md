# For starters 101

## Python

assd sa as as asd asssss

## Maths

- [entropy](entropy.md)
- standard deviation
  - incremental
  - non-parametric
- stats
  - effect size
  - significance
  - ranking (SK)

# Smarter Scripting
- little languages (regx, data models headers, __d__2options)

## scripting

- automate everything (makefile)
- test engine
- documentation (docstrings)
  - tuning
- decomposition (pipes, stdio)
- less is more (technical debt, my DATA model)

# Easier AI

- active learning (one thing per leaf)
Data

classifier
- Naive bayes
- knn (no clustering) <== can be regressions as well
- decision tree

clustering
- one sample per leaf (tiny training)
- regression and classifiication
- sample plus propergate

- lessons:
  - data reduction (just one sample per leaf)
  - when recursively clustering, use less and less to find poles.

#KE
W1: data.
  -   Little languages: data headers (bigger: regular expressions)
- Test suite
- documentation
- Pipe and filter/ architecture

W2: classification
- Bayes, 
- Labelling
